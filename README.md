# RSA_AlgorithmSecurityProject
RSA (public key &amp; private key) encryption &amp; decryption.
I built the project in 2 ways. One way as a Desktop Application by Java. Another way as a simple Web Application by JavaScript.
The application prompt the user to enter the p, q, and last but not least the public key they will use for encryption of the data.
After that the application calculates the (n), private key used for decryption of the data, and phi(n), and takes 2 inputs form user 
one is plaintext to encrypt and the other one is ciphertext to decrypt. The user can enter the ciphertext without encrpting a plaintext first and it will work correctly as long as the ciphertext is not in arabic language.
The application recommends valid encrption key(public key) values to the user to be used for encryption proccess.
